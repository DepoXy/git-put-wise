\-J|\-\-project\-path <path>  Project or archive path to use (this is an alt\-
                            ernative to using the final <path> argument,
                            so `git put\-wise \-J \.` == `git put\-wise \.`)

\-O|\-\-patches\-repo <repo>  Directory path to repo of patch archives (those
                            created on \-\-archive and consumed on \-\-apply*)

                            with \-\-archive and \-\-apply* (if unspecified you
                            will be prompted twice by GPG for each archive)

\-c|\-\-cleanup              With \-\-apply*, git\-rm each processed archive and
                            /bin/rm \-rf its unpacked directory [default]
\-C|\-\-no\-cleanup           With \-\-apply*, don’t cleanup (leave both)

\-N|\-\-author\-name <name>   With \-\-apply, set commit author name to <name>
\-M|\-\-author\-email <mail>  With \-\-apply, set commit author email to <mail>
\-L|\-\-leave\-author         With \-\-apply, uses author specified in patches
\-\-reset\-author            ^^^, uses local project’s user\.name <user\.email>
                            [default] (customize with \-N/\-M, \-L disables)

\-f|\-\-force                With \-\-push, uses git push \-\-force\-with\-lease
\-F|\-\-no\-force             With \-\-push, don’t \-\-force\-with\-lease [default]

\-\-explain                 With \-\-push, explain how tig prompt works [default]

\-U|\-\-no\-squash            Make new commits to patches repo

\-S|\-\-starting\-ref <ref>   On \-\-archive, format\-patch <starting gitref>\.\.HEAD
                            but generally for special circumstances

                          \- Hint: When combined with \-\-apply\-all, dry\-run
                            decrypts all patchkages, leaves them unpacked,
                            but does not apply them\.

.SH "ABOUT"
This program supports a particular Git workflow, wherein you can intermingle "private" and "protected" commits in the same branch as public (published) commits, without needing to manually manage separate branches\.
.
.P
This program manages the process for you, so you can always work from the same branch\. You won‘t have to worry about changing branches, moving branch pointers around, nor specifying what branch or commit to push to which remote branch, just to keep some commits local while pushing other commits\.
.
.P
This program also supports an oblique method for sharing changes between environments (i\.e\., between your machines), subverting the normal push/pull to/from a remote branch, but instead bundling and encrypting patch archives that will later be decrypted and applied to your projects\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
You might want such a feature if you don‘t want your private bits uploaded unencrypted to a third\-party service (like GitHub or GitLab)\. For example, this is how the author syncs their personal notes between two machines that cannot communicate otherwise\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Or you might want such a feature to defer publishing code changes from the machine you are using\. For example, say you‘re on the clock, but you need to quickly fix and add something to one of your many open source projects\. You can make the (possibly crude) change and get back to work\. Then, when you clock out, you can privately move that change to your personal machine to test it, refine it, and finally publish it\.

Push the appropriate commit to the remote branch:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ git put\-wise push
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Pull the latest commits, rebasing scoped commits as necessary:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ git put\-wise pull
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
On a client machine, create an encrypted patch archive with the latest commits and upload to remote Git host (e\.g\., GitHub):
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

@client $ cd path/to/project
@client $ git put\-wise archive \-O path/to/patches
@client $ cd path/to/patches
@client $ git push \-f
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Hint: Use the \fBPW_PATCHES_REPO\fR environ so you don\'t have to use the \fB\-O {path}\fR option\.
.
.P
On the leader machine, download the encrypted patches, decrypt, and apply to your local project:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

@leader $ cd path/to/patches
@leader $ git pull \-\-rebase
@leader $ git put\-wise apply\-all
