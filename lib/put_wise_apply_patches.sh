# ASSUMED: Within the put-wise patches repo, each of the Git files
# (ls-files) should be a GPG archive containing one or more patch files
# from the format-patch command for a specific project. And that archive
# should contain a manifest (metafile) specifying that project's path.
# - The decrypted and unpacked archives are never added to the repo.
# - *ASSUMED* because we expect put-wise manages the patches repo.
#   So we don't expect what we don't expect.

# ***

# ITSCOMPLICATED: Unlike the similar-ish `put_wise_pull_remotes`, for
# each project, we cannot do something "easy" like `git rebase --onto`,
# because `--onto` works on a specific branch, and not on a set of
# patch files.
# - So we might use an ephemeral intermediate branch on which to apply
#   those patches, and then we can rebase on top of that.
#   - But we'll only need such an intermediate branch if the project
#     has PRIVATE commits that need to stay ahead of other work. This
#     is so we apply the patches on commits before PRIVATE commits.

# ***

# This function implements 2 of the 5 put-wise actions,
# --apply and --apply-all. It's also the only action
# that doesn't assume PW_PROJECT_PATH is a path to a git
# project (and that's not a path to patches repo).
# - PW_PROJECT_PATH might be a legit project directory path;
#   or it might be a path to an archive file in PW_PATCHES_REPO;
#   or it might be empty if --apply-all.
