# Determines rebase ref. commit, and identifies one or more push remotes.
#
# - The rebase ref. is the youngest published commit, i.e., we can rebase
#   commits since this ref. and not worry about rewriting public history.
# - In the most basic use case where there's a single remote, the rebase
#   ref. is the remote HEAD.
#   - If you have a local 'release' (or 'private') branch, and the remote
#     branch REMOTE_BRANCH_RELEASE exists (e.g., 'publish/release'), sets
#       rebase_boundary='publish/release'
#   - For a feature branch (any branch not named 'release' or 'private'),
#     uses the remote name from the tracking branch, or from the --remote
#     CLI arg, paired with the feature branch name, e.g.,
#       rebase_boundary='<remote>/<branch>'
# - For a 'private' branch with no remote, uses the pw/private/in tag if
#   set, which is used by the put-wise-apply command and marks the latest
#   commit from the patches archive (which lets you move changes between
#   hosts using an encrypted patch archive, useful when you cannot use SSH
#   to git-fetch and still you want your data E2E encrypted between hosts).
# - May also baulk if a version or other tag is identified amongst the
#   rebase commits.
#
# - Also used by put-wise-push to suss other remote and branch vars.

# SORRY:
# - I don't generally like to "abuse" `local` like this. It seems
#   like a weird side-effect to have a fcn. set its caller's vars.
#   - But this is shell script, and passing data is not always so
#     simple or elegant.
#
# REFER:
# - This fcn. sets the following vars (its "return" values):
#     local_release=""
#     remote_release=""
#     remote_protected=""
#     remote_current=""
#     remote_name=""
#     branch_name=""
#     rebase_boundary=""
# - Other side effects:
#   - Calls `git fetch` as appropriate to ensure remote branch
#     ref is accurate/up to date.
#   - Fails if bad state detected (e.g., diverged branches), or if
#     the rebase boundary (rebase_boundary) cannot be identified or
#     verified.
#
# BWARE:
# - This fcn. does not verify rebase_boundary is reachable from HEAD.
#   - See resort_and_sign_commits_before_push, which will `exit 1` if
#     rebase_boundary diverges,

  # The pw/in tag signifies the final patch from the latest --apply command.
  # It's the remote's HEAD, essentially (minus PRIVATE commits). This is the
  # fallback sort-from, in case there's no remote branch or local 'release'
  # branch. Note that this will move PRIVATE commits toward HEAD, but it'll
  # leave behind PROTECTED commits that may precede pw/work. (The pw/work tag
  # is the merge-base from the latest --apply command. It's what the patches
  # were based from, and it signifies what this host pushed before that the
  # remote added work to. I.e., when this host pushed pw/work, it had just
  # resorted, and PROTECTED commits were bubbled toward pw/work. So if we
  # wanted to move those commits forward now, we'd have to set sort-from to a
  # commit preceding pw/work. Fortunately, we can use the 'release' branch,
  # which precedes these PROTECTED commits, as the sort-from base. Using this
  # tag is just a fallback, but note that it means we won't move earlier
  # PROTECTED commits forward. Which we can say is a feature of not having a
  # 'release' branch.

  # ***

  # Unless the 'pw/private/in' tag is set as the rebase_boundary default
  # (see above), use the protected remote (e.g., 'entrust/scoping') as the
  # default starting point for the sort-and-sign rebase (rebase_boundary).
  # - We'll pick a different starting point below if there's a remote
  #   release branch (e.g., 'publish/release') or if there's a local
  #   release branch (e.g., 'release'), which is the "normal" use case:
  #   - UCASE: Keep scoped (PROTECTED/PRIVATE) commits *ahead* of the
  #     'release' branches (so that you never publish scoped commits).
  #     - This is actually a core concept in put-wise: locally you have
  #       scoped commits that you never publish to the release remote.
  #       - PRIVATE commits are never pushed/pulled by put-wise (though
  #         you might sync them between personal hosts using SSH remotes
  #         and git-fetch).
  #       - PROTECTED commits are only shared via --archive or via
  #         --push to a protected remote (e.g., a private GH repo).
  # - Here we use the protected remote ('entrust/scoping') as the
  #   default in case there's no 'release' branch (local or remote).
  # - Note if this is the only rebase boundary identified, the scoped
  #   sort will not include PROTECTED commits that were previously
  #   pushed to the protected remote. Which is fine. User can manually
  #   sort-by-scope to bubble them up, if they care (and note that the
  #   protected remote does not guarantee linear history, and user may
  #   need to force-push if they bubble up previously pushed PROTECTED
  #   commits).
