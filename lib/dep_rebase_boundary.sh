# Reusable fcn. to determine oldest sort-by-scope commit automatically.
# - E.g., if you have a local 'release' (or 'private') branch, and the
#   upstream remote is 'publish/release', sets
#     sort_from_commit='publish/release'
# - Also used by put-wise-push to suss other remote and branch vars.
#
# SORRY: I don't generally like to "abuse" `local` like this. It seems
# like a weird side-effect to have a fcn. set its caller's vars.
# - But this is shell script, and passing data is not always so simple.
#   And I want to reuse the sort_from_commit susser without refactoring
#   complex code that's been working for years.
#
# REFER:
# - This fcn will set the following vars (its "return" values):
#     local_release=""
#     remote_release=""
#     remote_liminal=""
#     remote_protected=""
#     remote_current=""
#     remote_name=""
#     branch_name=""
#     sort_from_commit=""
# - Other side effects:
#   - Calls `git fetch` as appropriate to ensure remote branch
#     ref is accurate/up to date.
#   - Fails if bad state detected (e.g., diverged branches).

      # we could either rebase from the very first commit (easy solution),
