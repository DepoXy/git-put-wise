# Determines rebase ref. commit, and identifies one or more push remotes.
#
# The rebase ref. (nÃ©e sort-from-commit; also called the "rebase boundary"):
# - The rebase ref. is the youngest published commit, i.e., we can rebase
#   commits since this ref. and not worry about rewriting public history.
# - In the most basic use case where there's a single remote, the rebase
#   ref. is the remote HEAD.
#   - If you have a local 'release' (or 'private') branch, and the remote
#     branch REMOTE_BRANCH_RELEASE exists (e.g., 'publish/release'), uses
#       rebase_boundary='publish/release'
#   - For a feature branch (any branch not named 'release' or 'private'),
#     uses the remote name from the tracking branch, or from the --remote
#     CLI arg, paired with the feature branch name, e.g.,
#       rebase_boundary='<remote>/<branch>'
# - If there's no remote release or feature branch, uses the remote scoping
#   branch if it exists (which is where git put-wise push pushes protected
#   commits). The remote scoping branch varies:
#   - For a local 'release' or 'private' branch, uses REMOTE_BRANCH_SCOPING
#     (e.g., 'entrust/scoping').
#   - For a local feature branch, uses SCOPING_REMOTE_NAME/<branch>
#     (e.g., 'entrust/feature').
# - If no remote branch found at all, uses the pw/<branch>/in tag if set
#   (e.g., 'pw/private/in', 'pw/feature/in', etc.). This tag is used by the
#   put-wise-apply command and marks the latest commit from the patches
#   archive (which lets you move changes between hosts using an encrypted
#   patch archive, useful when you cannot use SSH to git-fetch and still
#   you want your data E2E encrypted between hosts).
#   - Note this is somewhat off-label usage for the pw/in tag, but w/e.
# - If still no reference found, falls back to latest version tag, if
#   found.
#
# Be aware the suss fails if a version or other tag is amongst the rebase commits.
# - LATER/2024-08-30: Tho subject to change, after we see how it works in practice.
#
# In addition to the rebase boundary, the function also identifies the
# push remotes.
# - These are the remotes described above that are probed when determining
#   the rebase boundary, e.g.,:
#     'publish/release' or 'publish/feature' (remote release or feature branch)
#     'entrust/scoping' or 'entrust/feature' (remote scoping branch)
# - If a remote branch exists, it'll be included.
# - If a remote is reachable, but the remote branch cannot be fetched,
#   it'll be included â€” this lets the user use `put-wise push` to make
#   their first push.
#   - If the remote branch cannot be fetched, the remote is pruned,
#     in case the branch was recently deleted, so that any obsolete
#     local ref is discarded.
# - If a remote is not defined, or if it cannot be reached and there's
#   no local ref to the remote branch, the remote branch is excluded.
#
# If no rebase boundary is identified, the function checks to see if
# *all* commits are already sorted & signed (sorted so that 'protected'
# and 'private' commits are bubbled-up, and signed if signing enabled).
# - If commits are not sorted or signed as expected, it'll print an
#   exhaustive list of actions the user can take to make the command
#   work (and there are lots of options!).
# - Otherwise the function returns truthy with rebase_boundary set
#   to the empty string, which tells the caller exactly what we told
#   you here.

# USER CONTROLS:
# - Set PW_OPTION_SKIP_REBASE=true (--skip-rebase) to probe the remote
#   branches, and to ignore rebase_boundary (sets it to empty string).
# - Set PW_OPTION_STARTING_REF=<REF> (-S | --starting-ref) to pick
#   your own rebase boundary.
#   - Use special ref named "ROOT" to rebase all commits.
# - Set other environs to change the convention branch and remote names:
#     LOCAL_BRANCH_PRIVATE
#     LOCAL_BRANCH_RELEASE
#     SCOPING_REMOTE_NAME, SCOPING_REMOTE_BRANCH
#     RELEASE_REMOTE_NAME, RELEASE_REMOTE_BRANCH
#   - Set PW_OPTION_REMOTE=<REMOTE> (-r | --remote) to specify the feature
#     branch remote.
# - If PW_OPTION_FORCE_PUSH=true (-f | --force, tells put-wise to
#   force-push), sets local_release="" and remote_release="" so that
#   the caller will ignore the release branches (and not force-push
#   to remote release branch).
# - Set PW_OPTION_ORPHAN_TAGS=true (--orphan-tags) to not exit nonzero
#   if tags found within the rebase area.
# - Use PW_ACTION_REBASE_BOUNDARY=true (--rebase-boundary) to call
#   this function from the command line, and to print its results.

# SORRY:
# - I don't generally like to "abuse" `local` like this. It seems
#   like a weird side-effect to have a fcn. set its caller's vars.
#   - But this is shell script, and passing data is not always so
#     simple or elegant.
#
# REFER:
# - This fcn. sets the following vars (its "return" values):
#     local_release=""
#     remote_release=""
#     remote_protected=""
#     remote_current=""
#     remote_name=""
#     branch_name=""
#     rebase_boundary=""
# - Other side effects:
#   - Calls `git fetch` as appropriate to ensure remote branch
#     ref is accurate/up to date.
#   - Fails if bad state detected (e.g., diverged branches), or if
#     the rebase boundary (rebase_boundary) cannot be identified or
#     verified and not all commits are sorted & signed.
#
# BWARE:
# - This fcn. does not verify rebase_boundary is reachable from HEAD.
#   - The caller is expected to call resort_and_sign_commits_since_boundary,
#     or to call must_confirm_shares_history_with_head directly, which
#     will `exit 1` (exit_1) if rebase_boundary ahead or divergent.

  # The pw/in tag signifies the final patch from the latest --apply command.
  # It's the remote's HEAD, essentially (minus PRIVATE commits). This is the
  # fallback sort-from, in case there's no remote branch or local 'release'
  # branch. Note that this will move PRIVATE commits toward HEAD, but it'll
  # leave behind PROTECTED commits that may precede pw/work. (The pw/work tag
  # is the merge-base from the latest --apply command. It's what the patches
  # were based from, and it signifies what this host pushed before that the
  # remote added work to. I.e., when this host pushed pw/work, it had just
  # resorted, and PROTECTED commits were bubbled toward pw/work. So if we
  # wanted to move those commits forward now, we'd have to set sort-from to a
  # commit preceding pw/work. Fortunately, we can use the 'release' branch,
  # which precedes these PROTECTED commits, as the sort-from base. Using this
  # tag is just a fallback, but note that it means we won't move earlier
  # PROTECTED commits forward. Which we can say is a feature of not having a
  # 'release' branch.

  # ***

  # Unless the 'pw/private/in' tag is set as the rebase_boundary default
  # (see above), use the protected remote (e.g., 'entrust/scoping') as the
  # default starting point for the sort-and-sign rebase (rebase_boundary).
  # - We'll pick a different starting point below if there's a remote
  #   release branch (e.g., 'publish/release') or if there's a local
  #   release branch (e.g., 'release'), which is the "normal" use case:
  #   - UCASE: Keep scoped (PROTECTED/PRIVATE) commits *ahead* of the
  #     'release' branches (so that you never publish scoped commits).
  #     - This is actually a core concept in put-wise: locally you have
  #       scoped commits that you never publish to the release remote.
  #       - PRIVATE commits are never pushed/pulled by put-wise (though
  #         you might sync them between personal hosts using SSH remotes
  #         and git-fetch).
  #       - PROTECTED commits are only shared via --archive or via
  #         --push to a protected remote (e.g., a private GH repo).
  # - Here we use the protected remote ('entrust/scoping') as the
  #   default in case there's no 'release' branch (local or remote).
  # - Note if this is the only rebase boundary identified, the scoped
  #   sort will not include PROTECTED commits that were previously
  #   pushed to the protected remote. Which is fine. User can manually
  #   sort-by-scope to bubble them up, if they care (and note that the
  #   protected remote does not guarantee linear history, and user may
  #   need to force-push if they bubble up previously pushed PROTECTED
  #   commits).
