# Determines rebase ref. commit, and identifies one or more push remotes.
#
# - The rebase ref. is the youngest published commit, i.e., we can rebase
#   commits since this ref. and not worry about rewriting public history.
# - In the most basic use case where there's a single remote, the rebase
#   ref. is the remote HEAD.
#   - If you have a local 'release' (or 'private') branch, and the remote
#     branch REMOTE_BRANCH_RELEASE exists (e.g., 'publish/release'), sets
#       sort_from_commit='publish/release'
#   - For a feature branch (any branch not named 'release' or 'private'),
#     uses the remote name from the tracking branch, or from the --remote
#     CLI arg, paired with the feature branch name, e.g.,
#       sort_from_commit='<remote>/<branch>'
# - For a 'private' branch with no remote, uses the pw/private/in tag if
#   set, which is used by the put-wise-apply command and marks the latest
#   commit from the patches archive (which lets you move changes between
#   hosts using an encrypted patch archive, useful when you cannot use SSH
#   to git-fetch and still you want your data E2E encrypted between hosts).
# - May also baulk if a version or other tag is identified amongst the
#   rebase commits.
#
# - Also used by put-wise-push to suss other remote and branch vars.

# SORRY:
# - I don't generally like to "abuse" `local` like this. It seems
#   like a weird side-effect to have a fcn. set its caller's vars.
#   - But this is shell script, and passing data is not always so
#     simple or elegant.
#
# REFER:
# - This fcn. sets the following vars (its "return" values):
#     local_release=""
#     remote_release=""
#     remote_liminal=""
#     remote_protected=""
#     remote_current=""
#     remote_name=""
#     branch_name=""
#     sort_from_commit=""
# - Other side effects:
#   - Calls `git fetch` as appropriate to ensure remote branch
#     ref is accurate/up to date.
#   - Fails if bad state detected (e.g., diverged branches), or if
#     the rebase boundary (sort_from_commit) cannot be identified or
#     verified.
#
# BWARE:
# - This fcn. does not verify sort_from_commit is reachable from HEAD.
#   - See resort_and_sign_commits_before_push, which will `exit 1` if
#     sort_from_commit diverges,

put_wise_identify_rebase_boundary_and_remotes () {

  # This fcn. will exit if the boundary cannot be identified and the
  # commits are not sorted & signed, or will return nonzero instead

  #   does: git-bump-version-tag.

    # leave behind PROTECTED commits that may precede pw/work. (The pw/work tag
    # is the merge-base from the latest --apply command. It's what the patches

    #   release branch (e.g., 'publish/release') or if there's a local
    #   release branch (e.g., 'release'), which is the "normal" use case:
    #   - UCASE: Keep scoped (PROTECTED/PRIVATE) commits *ahead* of the
    #     'release' branches (so that you never publish scoped commits).
    #     - This is actually a core concept in put-wise: locally you have
    #       scoped commits that you never publish to the release remote.
    #       - PRIVATE commits are never pushed/pulled by put-wise (though
    #         you might sync them between personal hosts using SSH remotes
    #         and git-fetch).
    #       - PROTECTED commits are only shared via --archive or via
    #         --push to a protected remote (e.g., a private GH repo).
    # - Here we use the protected remote ('entrust/scoping') as the
    #   default in case there's no 'release' branch (local or remote).
    # - Note if this is the only rebase boundary identified, the scoped
    #   sort will not include PROTECTED commits that were previously
    #   pushed to the protected remote. Which is fine. User can manually
    #   sort-by-scope to bubble them up, if they care (and note that the
