  # Because HEAD and scoping are in same branch, we only need to check

  # then we can deduce that patch_base is also visible from HEAD.
  # - This condition will have been violated if the user rebased past
  #   patch_base (whether it's starting_sha, pw/branch/out tag, etc.).
  #   There's nothing we can do in this case; the user must fix the
  #   divergence, or find a different starting commit to use.
  #   - User's best option to restore the universe is to rebase their
  #     recent changes on top of the patch_base.
  #   - If they want to force-push instead and deal with the rebase on
  #     the remote, that's their decision, they do they, but this script
  #     won't be involved. This particular sitation also seems like a
  #     rare occurrence, especially if the user only uses put-wise to
  #     manage pushing/archiving and pulling/applying changes.
