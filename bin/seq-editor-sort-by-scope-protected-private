# USAGE:
#
#   GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR='/path/to/git-rebase-sort-by-scope-protected-private' \
#     git rebase -i <gitref>

# USETO: This automatic rebase reorders commits based on a couple
#        of special prefixes and rules that the author uses.
#
#        - Reorder commits being rebased using stable sorting:
#          - If commit message has "PRIVATE: " prefix, order latest.
#          - If commit message has "PROTECTED: " prefix, order penultimate
#            to "PRIVATE: ".
#          - For all other commits, leave them (as older ancestors to
#            the "PRIVATE: " and PROTECTED: " commits).
#
#        - This is a "contactless interactive" rebase, so to speak:
#          There is no user interaction involved.

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# DEV: Uncomment to show rebase-todo before and after:
#  DX_SHOW_TODO=true
DX_SHOW_TODO=${DX_SHOW_TODO:-false}

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# SAVVY: Good-to-know's about being a GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR:
#
# - You can `export` environs before `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=... git rebase ...`
#   to see them herein; but you cannot (obviously) pass back any variables
#   to the caller (though you could use a file to return data).
#
# - Any nonzero return causes git to print the following to stderr:
#     hint: Waiting for your editor to close the file... error:
#       There was a problem with the editor 'git-rebase-sort-by-scope'.
#   And then git-rebase returns 1 (regardless of the exit code here).
#
# - If the rebase-todo is truncated or all commented, git prints to stderr:
#     fatal: No rebase in progress?
#   So the git-rebase caller could redirect stderr and replace with their
#   own message. (This script prints to stdout on error.)
#
# - The current working directory is the repo root.

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# REFER: The `awk -i inplace` specifies an awk extension:
#
#   https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Extension-Sample-Inplace.html

# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #

# USAGE: This rebase-resort looks for commit messages with specific prefixing.
#
# - Any commit message that starts with "PROTECTED: " or "PRIVATE: "
#   will be resorted "upwards" chronologically to be the latest commits.
#
#   - The "PRIVATE" commits will bubble up to be the latest commits,
#     and the "PROTECTED" commits will bubble up to follow those.
#
# - You can change the prefixes via the SCOPING_PREFIX and PRIVATE_PREFIX
#   environs, respectively.

# REFER: See the README for why this rebase pattern exists,
#        and how to use it practically.
